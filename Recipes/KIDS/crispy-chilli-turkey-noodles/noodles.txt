Ingredients
2 tbsp sesame oil
500g turkey mince
5cm piece ginger, grated
1 large garlic clove, crushed
3 tbsp honey
3 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp hot sriracha chilli sauce
350g dried udon noodles
2 limes, juiced, plus wedges to serve (optional)
2 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
4 spring onions, shredded
1 small bunch coriander, sliced (optional)
Method
STEP 1
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Once hot, add the turkey mince to the pan and fry for 10-12 mins until golden brown and crispy, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon as you go. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min. Stir in the honey, soy and chilli sauce and cook for 2 mins.

STEP 2
Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the noodles and cook following pack instructions. Drain and toss the noodles with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and all the lime juice, then divide between bowls. Top with the crispy turkey mince, carrot, onion and coriander. Serve with extra lime wedges for squeezing over.
