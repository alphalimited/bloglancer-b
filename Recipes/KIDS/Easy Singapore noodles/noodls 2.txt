Ingredients
200g vermicelli rice noodles
1 tbsp mild curry powder
¼ tsp turmeric
1 tsp caster sugar
1 tbsp sesame oil
2½ tbsp low-salt soy sauce
1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
1 onion , sliced
1 pepper , sliced (we used ½ green and ½ orange)
200g beansprouts
1 red chilli , sliced (optional)
Method
STEP 1
Boil the kettle and put the noodles in a large pan or bowl. Pour over enough boiled water to cover, pushing the noodles under the water to help them soften evenly. Set aside for 5-10 mins, until the noodles are completely soft. Mix the curry powder, turmeric, sugar, sesame oil, soy sauce and 1 tbsp water in a bowl.

STEP 2
Heat the wok until very hot. Add the sunflower oil, onion and pepper. Stir-fry for 3-4 mins until softened and starting to brown in places. Drain the noodles and add to the pan, along with the sauce mixture and beansprouts. Stir-fry for a further 3-4 mins, tossing everything through the sauce, until hot. Adjust the seasoning with a little more soy or sugar, if you like, and scatter over the chilli, if you like more spice.
