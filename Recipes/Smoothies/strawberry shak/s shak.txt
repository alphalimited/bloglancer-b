INGREDIENTS
8 ounces fresh strawberries, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 to 1 cup whole milk
1 tablespoon malted milk powder or regular powdered milk (optional)
1 pint high-quality strawberry ice cream (no fake flavors or dye)
INSTRUCTIONS
1 Prepare and freeze the strawberries. Hull 8 ounces strawberries, then thinly slice them. Place in a medium bowl, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and toss to combine. Place in the freezer for about 1 hour.
2 Freeze the glasses. Meanwhile, place 2 pint glasses or 4 smaller glasses in the freezer to chill
3 Blend the strawberries and milk. Place the strawberries in a blender, and scrape in all the syrupy juice that has accumulated at the bottom of the bowl. Add 3/4 cup whole milk and blend until the strawberries are pulverized. There should be no big chunks left at all.
4 Add the malted milk powder, if using. Add 1 tablespoons malted milk powder or powdered milk if desired and blend. (Note: The malted milk powder gives just a bit of extra depth and a hint of malty flavor without turning the shake into a true malt. If you opt to use regular powdered milk this also will just add a bit of richness and creaminess. But the powders are not necessary.)
5 Add the ice cream. Take the blender jar off the base, and add 1 pint strawberry ice cream. Stir it into the milk and strawberries by hand. Blend thoroughly. If it wonâ€™t blend very well or gets stuck, carefully add up to 1/4 cup more milk. Stir or shake if necessary.
6 Pour into glasses. Pour the milkshake out into the chilled glasses and garnish with strawberries. Slurp immediately!
